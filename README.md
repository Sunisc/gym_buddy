# Gym Buddy

#We are building a social media app that encourages working out, whether that be at the gym, the court, or at home. The app is tentatively named Gym Buddy, and it not only promotes a healthy workout schedule, but also connects intimidated first-time gym-goers with more experienced weight-lifting partners, and visitors and new neighbors with other locals looking to play a game of pick-up. 

This app will encourage community, and create a digital culture surrounding working out, much like Venmo achieved with digital payments between friends. You will be able to add your friends on Gym Buddy, find locals interested in a similar workout using GPS location, track your daily workout and diet routine, and view like and comment on your friends’ daily routines as well. Other methods of motivation include rewarding those who check in at the gym working out on a regular basis; this’ll promote routine and encourage going to the gym everyday at a certain time.
